A couple scripts to assist in automatically recording, playing back and encoding
TGM2P sessions.

Prerequisites:
   - A version of MAME that takes single-dash parameters.
     Or you can modify the script to use double-dash parameters.
     Recommended: shmupmame with TGM patches.
   - zenity for displaying the tag dialog in tgm-record if there is no terminal.
     Or you can just always run it in a terminal.
   - ffmpeg with libx264 support enabled for encoding.
     Or you can modify the script to not use libx264.
   - mplayer for searching for the last game in a record.
     Or you can just always encode the entire session and manually trim it or
     whatever.

Preparation:
  1. Set mameroot at the top of each script to the root of your MAME directory.
  2. Ensure that you have a script called "tgm" in your path that launches MAME
     with the correct parameters to launch tgm2p, and that it passes on any
     extra parameters to MAME without modification.
     Recommended script:
        #/bin/sh
        exec mame tgm2p "$@"
     Or you can modify the script to call mame directly.
  3. Modify the script in any additional ways required by the prerequisites
     above.  If you already fulfil the prerequisites, you probably don't need to
     change anything here.

Usage:
  1. Run tgm-record when you want to play TGM.
  2. When you quit MAME, you will be asked to "tag" the record, or discard it.
  3. Each tagged record will also have the date and time in its filename.
  4. The latest discarded record is also kept, just in case.
  5. To play back, run tgm-playback.
  6. It will list the recorded sessions available.
  7. Specify a record to play back. Tab-completion works.
  8. Answer any other questions it asks.
  9. The rest is entirely automated; it will run TGM, stop it when the input is
     finished, and process and encode the output.
 10. You can use tgm-delete to delete a saved record.

Note that unfortunately, MAME refuses to dump an AVI into a FIFO, so you must
have enough space for the entire AVI file of the session you are playing back,
which can be several gigabytes for long sessions.  This is true even if you are
only saving the last game, as that only affects the encoding phase.  It is thus
recommended that you restart MAME every couple of games to keep the records
short.
Hopefully this can be resolved at some point.
